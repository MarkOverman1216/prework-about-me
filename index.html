    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I'm a workaholic some people say. I've been working 4 jobs and going to school at JCCC.
      Some of the activities include construction, putting in floors, land scaping, accounting,
      programming(data manipulation), some web development and goofing off! I served a mission in
      Southern California for 2 years just helping people I met come closer to God and helped them
      anyway I could physically as well.
    </p>
    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>Overland Park, Kansas</p>
    <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
    <p>I really enjoy bowling, the outdoors and computers.</p>
    <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
    <p>Anything to do with programming, I love the problem solving,
      the challenge and the satisfaction at the end when you have a program that works.
    </p>
    <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
    <p>At Home! Still in OP, KS.</p>
    <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
    <p>I have enjoyed everything I've learned so far with my brother and it satisfies my dream job.
      So I figured I'd get some formal education and see where it takes me.
